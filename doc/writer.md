# Profiler – For the Writer/Reporter
Profiler is a responsive template for profiling individuals. An example: http://goo.gl/mLA9FT

It uses Google Drive for data storage, and has space for 3 data fields and a blurb. Find your favorite data-viz person, and let them know you want to use profiler. 

### Getting Started with Profiler
1. Make a copy (File → Make a Copy) of this spreadsheet: [http://goo.gl/FBC3iG](http://goo.gl/FBC3iG)
2. Ask your data-viz person for their Google email address. Press File → Share, and give them full edit permission on the spreadsheet.
3. Do NOT change anything on row 1 or column A. Let the data-viz people know what you want those fields to say.
4. The image section is a bit fiddly. For now, paste the link to the image you want to use in a comment field. The data-viz person will manually crop it, and fill out the corresponding image field on the spreadsheet. The image sizing adjustments and placement will depend heavily on how many profiles you're showing. This part will take the longest. Choose your photos first, then work on filling out the other fields.
5. When all fields are filled out, print out the sheet and have a second set of eyes check it for spelling/grammar mistakes.
6. Fix the mistakes in the spreadsheet.
7. Tell your data-viz person that it's ready to go.
8. Get a coffee and wait for a status update. This step will take a while for the data-viz person. This could take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour+, depending on how long it takes to upload the code.
9. Once they're ready, sit down with the data-viz person and fiddle with the profiler embed code  to fit your story.
10. You have successfully used profiler. Drinks are in order. It's 5 o'clock somewhere, after all.
