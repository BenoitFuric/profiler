profiler
========

What is this?
-------------

Responsive template for profiling individuals. We used this several times, but the first iteration was built on deadline the day of the mass shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Netwon, Connecticut.

---------------

The project contains the following folders and important files:

* ``/imgs`` -- You can place your images here. There's a placeholder for you in there.

How to use this
---------------

1. Make a copy of this Google doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AurS2EUbrPERdE9Nc1dMSGdfenFCN0FCTk9jZF9TVWc&usp=sharing
2. Once you have entered all the information, "Publish to the web..."
3. In the Publish window, you'll find a URL that will contain a key. Copy that and paste into line 28 of index.html
4. Adjust the ``<title>`` tags and anything else in the index.html file, as needed.
